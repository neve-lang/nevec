 * Helper class that simplifies the process of building an IR [Op] from the information of another.
 *
 * # Motivation
 *
 * [Junction] is powerful, but its behavior can sometimes be undesirableâ€”it *always* reduces the composes given to
 * it together.
 *
 * For this reason, [Viewing] serves a very similar purpose, but it does *not* reduce the undesired [Composes][Compose]
 * together.
 *
 * @param desired The list of [Composes][Compose] that are desired.  It must not be empty.
 * @param viewing The list of [Composes][Compose] that are only being viewed.  It must also not be empty.
